                ----------
                BREAKDOWN:
                ----------
                (?<=^|\\s|"|') = positive lookbehind: whatever precedes (?<=) the selected text should be the start of a new line (^) OR (|) a whitespace character ie space (\s which becomes \\s because of the terminator) OR (|) quotes (") OR (|) apostrophe (')
                (?=['"\\s,;:.]) = positive lookahead: whatever follows the selected tet should be an apostrophe, quotation mark, whitespace, semicolon, colon, or fullstop 
                PURPOSE:
                This prevents finding matches of the selected text/word WITHIN OTHER WORDS. E.g. Selected text = "nate" -> find "nate" within "passionate" which is problematic. With the regex this is prevented
